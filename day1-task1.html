    <pre> Ankit Mishra's poetry collection Threads of Trust is a manifestation of an ordinary person’s life to 
          discover love, sensuality, separation, and itself. Each poem lingers in the duality of life between the 
          erotic and exotic, the lost and the aware, the breaking and the healing, and the life and the death itself.


          These poems will take readers on a subconscious journey where longing often defeats the logic, a 
          paradoxical reality of all living well. These poems will leave the readers with the task of weaving the 
          broken threads of trust. 

        
          Ankit Mishra published his debut book, A journey beyond borders, in 2016. Since then, Ankit has 
          published his poems in multiple international anthologies in more than three languages. Ankit Mishra 
          currently lives in Ontario, Canada, and actively writes on social media under the pen name of 
          “@DrunkardPoet”.
